# RoboticsCode

## This is where I store the drive code for the robotics team I have been on. The robotics program is run by FTC. I recomend joining a team because it is a really great learning experience. Find out about FTC at https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc!!

### This code is from the 2887 Edina robotics team BucketBrigade. All the code here is public and I hope whoever finds this will give feedback and/or copy it and add on to it.
